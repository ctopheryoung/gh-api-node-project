#### March 18, 2016

#### By Chris Young

## Description

A simple Node.js web application using the GitHub API that allows users to retrieve all public repositories of any GitHub user that is searched. Epicodus JavaScript week one code review.

## Set-Up Instructions

To run the app locally, you will need to download the project from my github repository: https://github.com/ctopheryoung/gh-api-node-project

#### NPM/Bower Install
Once the project has been cloned onto your local machine, you will need to install the Node & Bower dependencies. On the command line, navigate to the root of the project directory and run the following commands:
* npm install
* bower install

#### GitHub API Key
In order to make GitHub API requests, you will need a key/personal access token.

To create a token, visit the Settings area of your own Github account, select Personal Access Tokens from the sidebar on the left, and click the Generate New Token button in the upper-right corner. Do not check any boxes on the next page, and click Generate Token to get your key.

This key will then need to be placed inside of a ".env" file at the root level of the local project directory.
